# Financial Analysis and Reporting Dashboard

### Project Overview

This project revolves around constructing a data analysis dashboard with Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs), compares regional performance, analyzes financial trends, and provides insights for strategic decision-making. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, stakeholders gain access to visually presented insights for informed decision-making and business growth.

### Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:
- Develop a comprehensive data analysis dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs) of the company.
- Compare regional performance across different locations.
- Analyze financial trends over time.
- Provide insights for informed decision-making and business growth.

### DataSets

- **General Ledger Dataset**: Dataset for analyzing the company's financial transactions across years.
- **Chart of Accounts Dataset**: Dataset categorizing the company's accounts for financial analysis.
- **Date Dataset**: Dataset providing date details for time-based analysis.
- **Region Dataset**: Dataset containing information on regions for geographical analysis.

### Tools
- **Microsoft Power BI**
- **Power Query**: Data Cleaning & Transformation
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Data Analysis
- **Visualization Tools**: Creating Reports and Dashboards

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The project starts with importing raw datasets into Power BI using Power Query.
2. **Data Preparation**: Using Power Query, the raw data is cleaned and structured to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. **Data Modeling**: The cleaned datasets are then modeled in Power BI to establish relationships between them.
4. **Data Analysis**: Data analysis is conducted using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive meaningful insights into key performance indicators, financial trends, and regional performance.
5. **Visualization and Reporting**: Finally, the project concludes with the creation of visualizations and charts using Power BI's visualization tools.

### Data Analysis Questions
- What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the company?
- How does regional performance vary across different locations?
- What are the trends in financial metrics over time?
- Are there any correlations between financial performance, regional performance, and other key metrics?

### Findings
- The dashboard successfully tracks key performance indicators, allowing stakeholders to monitor the company's overall performance.
- Regional performance varies, with certain regions outperforming others. This insight enables targeted marketing and strategic efforts.
- Financial trends reveal which areas are performing well and which ones may need attention or adjustment.
- Correlations between financial performance, regional performance, and other key metrics provide valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
